"""council.py - deterministic protocol engine for the LLM-Council feature.

Karpathy's 3-stage llm-council (https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council):
  Stage 1 "First Opinions" : N seats independently answer one question.
  Stage 2 "Review"         : judges peer-rank the answers with identities
                             anonymized, "so that the LLM can't play favorites
                             when judging their outputs."
  Stage 3 "Final Response" : a chairman synthesizes the final answer.

This file owns ONLY the DETERMINISTIC half of that protocol. It NEVER calls a
model. Everything here is pure, reproducible code:

  - anonymize    : strip author, relabel A/B/C... by stable sha256(id) order
  - mean-rank    : pure-code aggregation of every judge's ordering
  - dissent      : surface the answers the judges disagree about most
  - anchor guard : seed-driven, per-judge presentation order to cancel position
                   bias -- NO global RNG, NO Math.random; the seed is an argument
  - transcript   : write a json + a human-readable md audit artifact

The model GENERATIONS (the seat answers, each judge's ranking, the chairman
synthesis) are produced by the orca orchestration, NOT here -- see
skills/council/SKILL.md. WHICH model fills each role is an unverified assumption
quarantined in harness/council.config.yaml (verified: false). This engine reads
that config only to STAMP provenance into the transcript; none of the math above
ever branches on a model identity. That is the adapter boundary: finalize the
council later by editing one config file, not this engine.

CLI
  council.py rank <answers.json> [--judges judges.json] [--seed N]
                                 [--out DIR] [--config council.config.yaml]
        Full protocol. With judges -> writes the transcript (mean-rank, dissent,
        chairman brief). Without judges -> emits the blind packet to hand to the
        judge models, then stops (re-run with --judges once they have ranked).

  council.py prepare <answers.json> [--seed N] [--out DIR] [--config ...]
        Stage-2 setup only: anonymize + per-judge presentation order (the blind
        packet). Alias for `rank` without --judges.

  council.py selftest
        Run the bundled conformance vectors; assert the mean-rank aggregation
        and dissent are deterministic and correct. Exit 0 = PASS.

Schemas (the stable contract -- contains NO unverified value)
  answers.json : [{"id": str, "author": str, "text": str}, ...]
  judges.json  : [{"judge": str, "ranking": [<anon label>, ...]}, ...]  # best first
